1.1:
 - Added script for one way colliders.
   This requires the character's Collision Layermask to uncheck the "Ignore Raycast" layer.
   This is the layer that is used to make the platform intangible while the character passes through it.
   Prefabs in this project have been edited to make sure this layer is unchecked.

 - Added DropDown module to work with one way colliders
   Allows characters to jump down through a one way collider by pressing down and jump

 - Added Swimming module and water object

 - Update ClassicCharacter and DemoScene2 to demonstrate new abilities

 - Fix maximum air speed being constrained to range 0-1

 - Added longer demo scene (RunnerSceneDemo)

 - Edits to jump functions to make them more sensible, add LaunchCharacter function for movement changes that are not jumping

 - Add support for Unity-animated colliders by way of "AnimatedMover.cs"

 - Moved collider in DemoScene to prevent clipping

1.2:

 - Ladder object and LadderClimb module. Moving ladders work as well.

 - (Optional) allow characters on ladders to go both ways through OneWayPlatforms

 - Update Swim module to work with colliders that move underwater (don't stick, but start swimming)

 - Update OneWayPlatform to keep better track of ignored objects in case of reset.

 - Update ClassicCharacter and DemoScene2 to demonstrate new abilities and game objects

 - Add the AnimatedMover script that was forgotten in the previous update

 - Some deadzone tweaks for animations
 
 1.3:

 - Added new abilities; WallStick, WallClimb, NetClimb and Jetpack. Jumping from ladders now possible (optional). NetClimb will completely replace LadderClimb in the future, as a Ladder object can be created as a Net object with width 0.

 - WallStick is activated by moving into a wall and holding the analogue stick/arrow keys in the direction of the wall

 - WallClimb is activated by moving into a wall. Using the analogue stick a character can move up and down

 - Added a new character (HeroCubeCharacter) and a new scene (2.5DDemoScene) to showcase 2.5D capabilities, as well as the WallStick and Jetpack module

 - Added system for locking/unlocking abilities on level start or when entering a trigger, allows for pickups like the jetpack. Showcased in 2.5DDemoScene

 - Add scripts for moving/teleporting a character along the Z axis to add more 2.5D gameplay opportunities. Showcased in 2.5DDemoScene

 - Add scripts for rotating the world so that the character can turn corners. Showcased in 2.5DDemoScene

 - Edited ClassicCharacter and DemoScene2 to showcase the new Net objects and NetClimb module

 - Add a way to lock the movement of the character while another script is moving it (for example during a world rotation). Can be activated/deactivated via the CharacterControllerBase's LockMovement() method

 - Edited SpriteAnimator to make more intuitive sense. Replace rotation on Y with scaling on X, as 3D animations will flip more accurately this way

 - Clean up CapsuleTransform and deprecate CapsuleManipulator. Allow for easier position manipulation

 - Fixed SpriteAnimator and FixedUpdateRenderInterpolator causing weird visual glitches when large movements (teleportation) occurred.

 - Updated the ReadMe file to reflect current status
